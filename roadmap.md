# Multiplayer API Roadmap
This is a simple REST API for multiplayer games. Clients can retrieve, update, and delete the game state using game IDs.

## Goal
The lobby hosting functionality present in the tic-tac-toe example will be turned into an NPM package (in a separate repository). Then, the tic-tac-toe example will be refactored to use that NPM package. This NPM package and the accompanying example will allow new C4C projects to easily add multiplayer functionality.

## Milestones
* Tic-tac-toe example (complete)
* Lobby hosting in tic-tac-toe example (almost complete)
* Multiplayer API NPM package (not started)
* Refactor tic-tac-toe example to use Multiplayer API NPM package (not started)
